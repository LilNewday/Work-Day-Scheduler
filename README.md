# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The goal was to create a localized work day scheduler that you could input text yourself into the timeblocks for the day. It's not for every schedule, but at least for the standard 9 - 5 it does the trick. I needed something to help keep track of my typical work schedule and this is a nice simple solution. This is a nice simple fix for people who want to write down a daily schedule for their work day by the hour and even update it if it needs to be updated. With this work I familiarized myself a bit more with jQuery and did some work with Day.js. Overall it wasn't too bad of an experience.
